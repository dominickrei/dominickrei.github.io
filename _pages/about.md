<!-- 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hello, I am a third-year PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte advised by [Dr. Srijan Das](https://srijandas07.github.io/). My research focuses on multi-modal learning and video understanding, specifically for activities of daily-living observed in real-world environments.
<!-- 
Previously, I was a member of the [Image Privacy Lab](https://fan-group.github.io/imageprivacy/) under the supervision of [Dr. Liyue Fan](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/lfan4/). Our research adapted the standard notion of differential privacy to image data, with the objective of creating robust image obfuscation algorithms that offer rigorous privacy guarantees while preserving high utility. -->
